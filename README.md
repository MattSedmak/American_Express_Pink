## The brief

The brief for the assigment was that a company (of our choice) wanted 'something cool' for their website. We had to make sure than we followed the company's graphic design guildlines. I went with a campagin launch landing page for a collab between American express and a fictious cancer charity. We had to implemnet at least one animation and one svg.

## Process

The sketch of my landing site was created in Adobe Xd.

I createad a logo for the ficticous cancer charitry, The Cancer Foundation i Adobe illustrator and finally the Amex pink card and background picture were edited i Photoshop.

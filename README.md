# America Express x The Cancer Foundation

Assigment for Web & graphic design course.

## The brief

The brief for the assigment was that a company (of our choice) wanted 'something cool' for their website. We had to make sure than we followed the company's graphic design guildlines. I went with a campagin landing page for a collab between American express and a fictious cancer charity.
